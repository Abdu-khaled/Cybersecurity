# Cybersecurity

## what is cybersecurity ?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting people, systems and data from `cyberattacks` by
using various technologies, processes and policies.

- At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is the key to overall `risk management` strategy,
and specifically, `cyber risk management`. Common cybersecurity threats include `ransomware`
and other `malware`, `phishing` scams, `data theft` and more recentlty, attacks powered by 
`arificial intelligence` (AI).

- As `cyberthreats` grow in sophistication and frequency, organizations are increasing their
investments in prevention and mitigation. The Inernational Data Corporation (IDC) projects 
that security spending will reach USB 377 bilion by 2028.


## Why is cybersecurity important?
Cyberattacks and cybercrime can disrupt, damage and destroy businesses, communities and lives. Security incidents can lead to identity theft, extortion and the loss of sensitive ingormation, impacts that can signigicantly affect businesses and economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.

But a more pertinent question may be: "Why is cybersecurity especially important right now?"

- Today, cybercriminals are using new technologies to their advantage. For instance, businesses embracing cloud computing for efficiency and innovation. But bad actors view this advancement as an expanding attack surface ripe for exploitation.
