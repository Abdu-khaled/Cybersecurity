# Cybersecurity

## what is cybersecurity ?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting people, systems and data from `cyberattacks` by
using various technologies, processes and policies.

- At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is the key to overall `risk management` strategy,
and specifically, `cyber risk management`. Common cybersecurity threats include `ransomware`
and other `malware`, `phishing` scams, `data theft` and more recentlty, attacks powered by 
`arificial intelligence` (AI).

- As `cyberthreats` grow in sophistication and frequency, organizations are increasing their
investments in prevention and mitigation. The Inernational Data Corporation (IDC) projects 
that security spending will reach USB 377 bilion by 2028.


## Why is cybersecurity important?
Cyberattacks and cybercrime can disrupt, damage and destroy businesses, communities and lives. Security incidents can lead to identity theft, extortion and the loss of sensitive ingormation, impacts that can signigicantly affect businesses and economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.

But a more pertinent question may be: "Why is cybersecurity especially important right now?"

- Today, cybercriminals are using new technologies to their advantage. For instance, businesses embracing cloud computing for efficiency and innovation. But bad actors view this advancement as an expanding attack surface ripe for exploitation.



## Tech trends driving cyber threats

One of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals and security operations teams is the constantly evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the evolving threats alongside it.

Emerging technologies, while offering tremendous advantages for businesses and individuals, also present opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks on critical systems for example:


- **Cloud computing**: On-demand access to computing resources can increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfiguration, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.

- **Multicloud environments**: A multicloud approach introduces risks such as increased attack surface, identity access management gaps, cloud sprawl, fragmented security, capabilities and heightened risk of human error or misconfiguration.

- **Distributed work**: Remote work, hybrid work and bring-your-own-devices (BYOD) policies mean more connections, devices applications and data for security teams to protect-and for threat acrtors to exploit.


- **The Internet Of Things**: Many connected devices-vehicles, appliances, and other physical objects within IoT networks are unsecured or improperly secured by default and can ve easily hijacked by bad actors.


- **Artificial Intelligence**:  Generative AI in particular is a new threat landscape already exploited through methods such as prompt injection and zero knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK). Machine learning models are becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be easily exploited by threat actors to launch more sophisticated attacks.
